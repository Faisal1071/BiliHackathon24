## Individual Learning goal and reflection 

Learning Goal:

Improve skills in combining hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi) with software, focusing on real-time data transmission, building APIs, and setting up alert systems.

Reflection:

The project provided valuable experience in connecting hardware with software, designing an efficient backend, and implementing a working notification system. The next step is to explore IoT further and refine real-time data handling techniques.
