# Python API

This is the API, we use for running the App.

## Running

To run the API, you will first need to create an Virtual Environment using the command `python3 -m venv .venv`. Then you can enter this Virtual Environment using the command `source .venv/bin/activate`. After that is done, you should install the dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. To run the API, you can just type `fastapi dev main.py`.
